# 2418. Sort the People

You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of **distinct** positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

### Example 1:

**Output:** ["Mary","Emma","John"]

### Example 2:

**Input:** names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
